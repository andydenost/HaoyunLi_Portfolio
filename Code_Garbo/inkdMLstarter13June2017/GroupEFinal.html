                            He told Harris, one of the commander, that “ my whole family was brutally murdered by the Nazis. I then escaped to a remote island and accidentally I found a treasure stash. I am willing to donate all I have now to MI5 for combatting the Nazis. My only request is that I have to destory the Nazis myself. You have to support me unconditionally.” Harris replies:” How can be of your service Sir?” Garbo:” I want to sneak into German’s barracks and providing you with secret information.” Harris gazes at this small little man and is amazed by his courage and strength. He arranged cosmetic surgery for Garbo to change his look. He sends Garbo along to German with one of cargo ship.<br>

He tells Fred:” I have been working in London as a detective for years in the hope that I can gather some useful information about the Allies. I want to help the great Axis. Actually, I have known for a fact that the Allies have been trasporting weapons through the train near Calais.” Fred sends his troops to confirm wether the information is factual.

He thinks to himself” is it a female spy?” Garbo appears to be increasingly cautious at this moment, He slows down to look around his surroundings. This suspicious act confirms Fred’s judgement that Fred is a double spy.

Garbo and the woman flirt with each other. Fred hears the loud noise from their bantering with each other. Fred is still not convinced. He pokes a hole on the window and he sees that Garbo lies naked with the woman in his arm. Fred shakes his head:” young people these days, he has his wife, now he is in bed with another woman. unbelievable!” From then on, Fred dismisses most of his doubtful thoughts about Garbo.

                            Garbo's success saved millions of people's lives, the change he made in the Normandy War changed the World War II, indirectly changed the world. Garbo did what he had said. German pays heavy price in this Campaign. It marks the beginning of the end of Second World War. The Allies finally won WWII at the end. Obviously, Garbo plays a very important role in WWII victory. Interestingly, Garbo is awarded the Iron Cross Second Class for his “effort” in German war. He also receives MBE from King George VI at the same time.
