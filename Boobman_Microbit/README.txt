It needs two micro:bits to running the game:

one board uses Project2_Player1.hex
the other uses Project2_Player2.hex

Player 1 initial point is on left-top corner,
Player 2 initial point is on right-bottom corner.

Please make sure your player start point when the game start.  

notice:
moving function is combine the rotation (accelerometer) and B button.
For example:
If you want to make one step to the right, please tilt the board to the right and press once B button at the same time.
If you want to make two steps to the right, please tilt the board to the right and press twice B button.

A button is "set bomb" button. It could set up to two bombs at most. After all the bomb effect ending, you could set new bomb.

Thank you.
